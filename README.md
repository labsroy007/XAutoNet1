The purpose of this work is to predict onset of sepsis in ICU patients 6 hours before using their physiological data and to provide diagnostic maps to clinicians or doctors for assisting them in making decisions. <br/>
The main contribution of this paper are listed below-
*	Developing a highly accurate predictive model to identify patients with sepsis at an early stage by taking a minimal number of features as input.
*	Considering the complexity of EMR data of ICU patients, a novel CNN-based autoencoder is introduced for extracting useful information, which is appropriately utilized by the model, helping it classify better.
* Implementation of proper and detailed pre-processing of data to retain important information as it belongs to critical care patients.
* Use of GradCAM for explaining the feature extraction process by Autoencoder and SHAP for digging out the hidden reasons behind the model's prediction.

For a quick walk through of our project we are providing a graphical abstract that will help you understand each process.</br>
